= Demonstration of Multi binding Stream apps

In the case where stream apps need to consume or produce multiple streams the following scenario may provide an example.

== Scenario
This artificial scenario consists of 3 apps representing a kitchen, waitron and customer of a restaurant.

* Once the kitchen app is live it will send an open message.
* When customer receive the open message it places 3 random orders of food, hot drinks and cold drinks.
* The waitron receives order from customers and passes those to the Kitchen.
* The Kitchen prepares and sends out the food or hot drinks or cold drinks.
* The waitron receives the food or drinks and delivers to the Customer.
* The customer pays for the items.
* The Waitron acknowledges receipt.

The set of properties below are required to connect the various endpoints.
The DSL to create and deploy this scenario is: `kitchen || waitron || customer`
Assuming the apps are registered with those names.

[source,properties]

app.customer.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.open.destination=openDest
app.customer.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.order.destination=orderDest
app.customer.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.payment.destination=paymentDest
app.customer.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.receive.destination=receiveDest

app.kitchen.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.coldDrinks.destination=coldDrinksDest
app.kitchen.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.food.destination=foodDest

app.kitchen.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.orders.destination=ordersDate
app.kitchen.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.staff.destination=staffDest

app.waitron.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.atWork.destination=staffDest
app.waitron.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.coldDrinks.destination=coldDrinksDest
app.waitron.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.delivery.destination=receiveDest
app.waitron.spring.cloud.stream.bindings.food.destination=foodDest
